## Background 

### History of the African Elephant Database and Status Reports 

The African Elephant Database (AED) originated from the African Elephant Survey carried out by Iain Douglas-Hamilton in the late 1970s, which led to the first continental estimate for elephant numbers, produced in 1979 (Douglas-Hamilton, 1979). In 1986, Douglas-Hamilton and colleagues started to compile this information into a geographical information system. Using data accumulated from questionnaire replies, surveys and interviews, a database of elephant population estimates and distribution was assembled (Burrill & Douglas-Hamilton, 1987). An updated version was produced in 1992 (Douglas-Hamilton et al., 1992), which included the use of spatial models to estimate populations for the central African forests, as only a very small proportion of this area had been surveyed at that time.
  
In 1992, the AED became the direct responsibility of the IUCN Species Survival Commission’s African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG). Since that time, the structure and management of the AED has been overseen by a group of technical experts from within the AfESG known as the Data Review Working Group (DRWG), and chaired since mid-2014 by Dr. Chris Thouless. The DRWG oversees the selection and categorisation of data to be included in the AED; agrees on new features, tools and analyses; and reviews the content of the AESR. Decisions made by the DRWG and additional reviewers are coordinated and implemented by AfESG Secretariat staff and contracted consultants. For this report, additional reviewers were added to focus on and strengthen specific areas. The authorship of this report reflects these contributions.
 
Initially housed at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, the AED was until April 1998 a collaborative effort of the Global Environment Monitoring System (GEMS), the Global Resource Information Database (GRID) of UNEP and the IUCN/SSC AfESG. In April 1998 the AED was moved from UNEP to its present location in the AfESG offices in Nairobi. Although the AED was transitioned to a web-based platform in 2012 it continues to be managed by the AfESG Secretariat from Nairobi through its website at africanelephantdatabase.org, where data from all earlier AED updates is publicly accessible, and more recent data is provisionally released whenever possible.
 
Today the AED is the most comprehensive database on the status of any single species of mammal in the wild.

The AfESG’s preparation of African Elephant Status Reports (AESR) began in the mid-1990s. Status reports are published to provide a complete picture of the status of the species based on the data within the database up to a certain point in time.  Prior to the present report, four reports of the AED were published: the African Elephant Database 1995 (Said et al., 1995), the African Elephant Database 1998 (Barnes et al., 1999), the African Elephant Status Report 2002 (Blanc et al., 2003), and the African Elephant Status Report 2007 (Blanc et al., 2007). These reports are freely accessible as well as available for download, in PDF format, on the AED website. Other provisional data were posted on the AED website between the AESR 2007 and the AESR 2016, but this report replaces them.
 
With the transition to an online platform (www.africanelephantdatabase.org), the AED has undergone its most significant change in over 20 years. This has been both challenging and rewarding, with many lessons we have learned now being used by other groups working on species databases. We hope this report contributes to a wider discussion about the value of monitoring to conservation, ensuring that policy decisions and the assessment of conservation activities are evidence-based whenever possible and that new initiatives plan and budget for support to databases to better enable the monitoring of progress and evaluation of performance.

### The Continuing need for a Continental Approach

A key issue in African elephant conservation is the variation in the status of the species across the 37 range states in which elephants occur. The desire to conserve and manage elephants is widespread, and even if opinions differ as to how best this goal can be achieved, it is widely agreed that decisions should rely on the best and most recent available information on the status of Africa’s elephants.
 
Since the publication of the African Elephant Status Report 2007, this goal has been furthered among the African elephant range states through their joint development and adoption by consensus of the African Elephant Action Plan (African elephant range states, 2010a), which provides objectives, strategies, and activities for the conservation and management of Africa’s elephants.  The AEAP recognizes the fundamental importance of monitoring progress and performance through constant reassessment of information on the status of the species throughout its range.

IUCN SSC’s African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) and its African Elephant Database (AED) occupy a unique and pivotal position with regard to this need, having been designated as the repository for information on the conservation status of the species by the parties to CITES (CITES Conference of the Parties, 2013b). The AfESG has had a specific mandate since CITES CoP15 in 2010 to provide the CITES Standing Committee “any new and relevant information on the conservation status of elephants” (CITES Conference of the Parties, 2013a) along with information and analyses from the CITES MIKE and ETIS monitoring programmes. This reporting, completed for four meetings of the CITES Standing Committee to date, draws heavily on the AED and has been proposed to CITES CoP17 in September 2016 to be adopted as a permanent reporting mandate. The AEAP also recognizes the vital contribution of the AED in one of its component activities to “maintain and update databases on elephant populations for management purposes”.

Such management information is required not only at the site and national level, but also regionally and continentally. Many elephant populations occur across international borders and a policy or management decision made in one country can affect elephant populations elsewhere. Changing land-use patterns or different approaches to tourism, such as trophy hunting in border areas, may have impacts beyond national boundaries. Likewise, the impact of policies concerned with ivory management and trade may affect elephants elsewhere. Civil instability and wars in Africa have sometimes led to a shift in populations across national boundaries. A regional and continental perspective is critical to identify and understand these ongoing dynamics and to support international and regional decision-making, including management of transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs).
 
These issues become all the more important as African elephants have faced a devastating new wave of illegal killing over the last decade (CITES Secretariat, 2016). Despite the intense pressures of illegal killing, with some results detailed later in this report, African elephants continue to live outside protected areas and the majority of elephant range may still be found in unprotected areas. This poses additional challenges for wildlife authorities and wildlife managers, as levels of human-elephant conflict continue to be high, increasing and politically charged in many parts of the continent, and especially where human and agricultural expansion moves into new areas already occupied by African elephants.  Many lessons have been learned regarding the challenges in mitigating this conflict (Hoare, 2000, 2015), the importance of broader landscape level land-use planning and what will be required in the future if elephants are to persist in the long term.

All these issues highlight the need to census and manage elephants across borders and the need to keep this information up to date and available in the AED in support of conservation action across the continent. The demand for and continued use of publications like the AESR and other analyses enabled by the AED demonstrate the ongoing need for this type of data even after the current pressures from illegal wildlife trafficking have been reduced. Conservation efforts, including implementation and monitoring of national, regional and continental strategies and action plans, should be informed by up-to-date and reliable data on elephant numbers and distribution. The AED and AESRs can also provide invaluable insights into the effectiveness of conservation responses.

## About this Report

### The African Elephant Status Report 2016

The AESR 2016 is the fifth printed AESR produced by the AfESG. Like its predecessors, it aims to provide the most authoritative, comprehensive and up-to-date information on the numbers and distribution and of the African elephant at national, regional and continental levels. The last year of admissible data collected for this report was 2015. The title refers to the year of publication rather than the last year of data included. This is the first status report since the AESR 2007 and some modifications have been implemented since that publication.

In preparing the AESR 2016, the AfESG has enjoyed a close collaboration with the technical staff of Vulcan Inc to ensure that data from the Great Elephant Census (greatelephantcensus.com), sponsored by Paul G. Allen, were captured and presented in this report. Vulcan colleagues have also helped with the further development of the database, its web-based platform and in particular streamlining the system for adding new data. All elephant survey data from the GEC were submitted through the AED for inclusion in this report. 

Status reports are intended to help address contemporary elephant management and conservation needs and, therefore, a key question is how the estimates and guesses in the AESR 2016 relate to the true number of elephants in Africa at the end of 2015. When populations are declining, any time difference between the date of surveys and the cut-off date for the report will lead to the true number being lower than the recorded figure. This is more of an issue with the guesses than with the estimates in this report since the largest savanna populations have all been surveyed within the last two years. There are also reasons why the AED may under-record the true number of elephants: aerial counts, which make up the majority of the estimates, tend to undercount the true number of elephants; many of the guesses come from areas which are known to contain substantial elephant populations but have not been surveyed to the standard required for an estimate; and there are areas of elephant range for which there are no estimates or guesses. On balance the true number of elephants are likely greater than the estimates based on surveys alone, though not necessarily greater than the combined estimates and guesses. It is the continuing need to improve the accuracy and coverage of these numbers and ensure that they are as up to date as possible that make survey efforts such as the Great Elephant Census and periodic national surveys so important.

### Changes since the AESR 2007

Since the fourth report, the AESR 2007, the AED has moved to a web-based platform. Provisional, online-only updates have filled the gaps between the AESR 2007 and this report, and have been published on the AED website. Launched in 2012, the website is a platform for displaying new information incorporated into the database between full status reports, and also provides new ways to access the data from all the status reports as well as more detailed information on new surveys than is available in the AESR 2016. Readers are encouraged to visit the website to further explore the database.

A system for categorising and tracking changes in numbers was first introduced in the AESR 2007, resulting in the display of a “Cause of Change” for each area and an Interpretation of Changes table for each country and region as well as the continent. (“Cause of Change” has been renamed “Reason for Change” in this report; see below.) This system is intended to distinguish between real changes in numbers and changes in survey techniques or area of survey coverage, thus limiting inappropriate extrapolations about trends over time.
  
The Definite, Probable, Possible, and Speculative (DPPS) system, in use since 1995, was designed to describe uncertainty and data quality. However the calculations underpinning it are complex and its display of population numbers difficult to understand and interpret. Although the AESR 2007 emphasizes that “comparing guesses to derive population trends is a meaningless exercise,” the four-category “DPPS” itself does not explicitly articulate the proportion of elephant numbers that are guesses (i.e. population figures that do not meet the criteria required to qualify as population estimates).

To simplify the presentation of elephant numbers and clearly demonstrate the calculations leading to the totals at the national, regional, and continental levels, the DPPS has been replaced in this report by the Alternative Data Display (ADD), which classifies numbers either as estimates or guesses, and distinguishes what kinds of surveys have provided the figures. In contrast to the DPPS, the estimates derived from surveys in the AESR 2016 are additive, so that the rows, listed by survey types, total to the country totals and the country level totals add to the regional totals, and so forth. Very small differences in the totals in the tables may occur due to rounding of decimal places. Guesses are not completely additive because they include upper and lower confidence limits from certain types of survey. Columns involving confidence limits (CL) remain the necessary exception, as adding CLs requires the pooling of variances to derive a new CL appropriate for the sum total. Furthermore, population estimates are now aligned with the range area (km²) they cover in the same table. While the printed AESR 2016 only uses the ADD, the DPPS has been retained on the online platform for comparative purposes.

## Data Types and Categorisation

The AED contains both spatial and non-spatial (attribute) data, managed using GIS software and a relational database management system. Spatial and relational data are both maintained in a PostgreSQL database with the PostGIS extension. These data sets are combined with base map data derived from the Digital Chart of the World (ESRI, Inc., 1992) a widely available global geographical dataset, the World Database of Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC & IUCN, n.d.), the World Resource Institute’s protected area data set (WRI, 2016) and a variety of other sources. Each of these background datasets is used as appropriate for the production of this report and none are considered authoritative datasets produced by the AfESG.

Data in a variety of formats are collected and received into the AED. Survey reports are obtained from wildlife management agencies and other organizations, and non survey-report data are shared in many formats by individuals and organizations with expert knowledge of an area. Preliminary range maps are shared with relevant experts to aid in modifying and revising. 

Data regarding an estimate or a guess are entered into the database using a submission form specific to the type of survey. Every estimate or guess is linked to spatial data, which is digitized and geo-referenced if not supplied by the data provider. Each submission consists of spatial data accompanied by appropriate attribute data manually extracted from the source material, such as transect length, flight speed, or dung decay rate. The source material (survey report, map, email, etc.) is then uploaded and linked to the submission.
 
Area measurements in the tables are calculated using geodetic coordinates on the WGS84 spheroid, for consistency across the African continent without projection-related errors. The surface areas of input zones, protected areas and elephant range are tallied at national, regional and continental levels. The overlay capabilities of GIS are used to determine percentages of both protected and surveyed elephant range.

The AED stores data on two basic variables reflecting the conservation status of African elephants, namely, numbers (abundance) and distribution (range). There are specific challenges associated with these kinds of data, related to their reliability and the availability and timing of new surveys. The ways that these issues are handled in this report are described in the following sections.

### Elephant Numbers

Although there are many different ways to count elephants, no single method is perfect. Possible sources of bias include the choice of survey technique, surveyor skill, quality and availability of adequate equipment, financial constraints, climatic conditions and vegetation cover. Ideally, data on elephants in any country should be collected by a wildlife management authority using qualified staff and standardized methods for collecting, recording and analysing data (Craig, 2012c; Hedges & Lawson, 2006). In reality very few countries have the means, either financial or in the form of expertise, to conduct systematic surveys on a regular basis and political strife in many range states sometimes makes survey work impossible.
As a result, elephant population data is collected by a variety of agencies and individuals, often without any direct linkage to one another and using a variety of different techniques. It is sometimes necessary to combine data from different types of surveys and different habitats to calculate a national estimate. Seasonal and cross-border movements of elephants are additional factors that can lead to inaccurate national estimates. Few cross-border surveys are conducted simultaneously to accurately estimate the size of such populations. Instead, they are generally treated as separate populations on either side of the border, which may occasionally result in either under- or over-counting. The end result is a collection of data of variable quality for most countries, and no data from formal surveys for many populations.

### Methods of Estimating Elephant Numbers

While there is no single or ideal method for counting elephants, each method has its advantages and disadvantages under different conditions. The brief description of some of the most important methods below is not intended to be detailed or exhaustive. For more details, the reader is referred to the specialized treatments of these subjects (Barnes, 1993; Craig, 1993, 2004, 2012c; Douglas-Hamilton, 1996; Hedges et al., 2013; Hedges & Lawson, 2006; Kangwana, 1996; Norton-Griffiths, 1978).
 
Methods for establishing elephant numbers fall into three broad categories: estimates from total counts, estimates from sample counts, and guesses.

Total Counts aim to see and record all the elephants in a defined area, either from the air or from the ground. Aerial total counts are conducted from fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters. The speed at which the aircraft is flown influences the accuracy of the count, with high speeds usually leading to undercounts (Norton-Griffiths, 1978). Aerial total counts are commonly used in open, savanna habitats, where elephants are unlikely to be hidden by forest or thick bush, especially but not exclusively in Eastern and Southern Africa. 

Total counts of a limited area can also be conducted at ground level by teams in vehicles or on foot. These are uncommon in Africa, but in a handful of places, total ground counts have been accomplished by attempting  to identify every individual in the population. This is only possible for intensively studied populations where animals can be observed readily. For such individual recognition studies to provide high quality data for the AED, every individual in the population must be registered. Many ongoing studies have so far covered only a fraction of these focal populations, and cannot therefore provide reliable estimates of entire populations. If elephants are being identified in a place where they concentrate for a specific resource (such as the Amboseli swamps in Kenya and Dzanga Bai in the Central African Republic), it may be difficult to work out how large an area is covered by the identified elephants, and the estimate will be affected by the timescale over which elephants have been enumerated (if too short it will not include occasionally seen individuals, if too long it may include ones that have already died).

Sample Counts, in which only a sample of the area is counted (usually between 3% and 20%), are generally conducted along transects which may be randomly distributed or systematically placed across the study area. The resulting data are used to calculate a population estimate with confidence limits. In contrast with total counts, which tend to produce underestimates of the true population, sample counts have in principle an equal chance of underestimating or overestimating the true population, provided that sampling error is the main source of error. In practice, however, factors such as high aircraft speed or dense vegetation cover lead to undercounts.

Direct Sample Counts are most commonly made from the air, but may also be conducted on the ground, either on foot or from vehicles. Aerial sample counts require considerable technical expertise and coordination, as well as the use of expensive additional equipment such as radar altimeters. Aerial sample counts are the most commonly employed survey technique in Eastern and Southern Africa.

Indirect Sample Counts are also referred to as dung counts. In low-visibility tropical forests, elephant abundance estimates typically use elephant dung density as a proxy for elephant density. Distance sampling (Buckland et al., 2001, 2015) along line transects estimates dung density and CLs within the area of interest (Hedges, 2012a; Strindberg, 2012). DISTANCE software (Thomas et al., 2010) is used for both survey design and analysis. Careful field protocol ensures accurate and precise estimates (Hedges et al., 2012a; Hedges & Lawson, 2006). Dung density is converted to elephant abundance using estimates of the rates of elephant defecation and dung decay and the surface area of the area surveyed. Dung decay rates can vary considerably across space and time: site and time-specific estimates of decay rates greatly improve accuracy in elephant abundance estimates (Hedges et al., 2012b; Laing et al., 2003). Estimates from well-conducted dung counts can be as accurate as those from direct methods, and more precise than those of aerial sample counts (Barnes, 2001, 2002).

At sites < 5,000km² and where elephant numbers are between a few tens and a few thousand, DNA-based capture-recapture methods have been used (Eggert et al., 2003; Gray et al., 2014; Hedges, 2012b; Hedges et al., 2013; Karanth et al., 2012b; Karanth et al., 2012c). Elephant DNA is extracted from as many dung piles as possible within the area of interest, and genetic fingerprinting is used to identify the number of unique genotypes (individuals) in the samples. The rates of repeat samples obtained can then be used to estimate the population size (Karanth et al., 2012a). 

Often, it is not possible to carry out a systematic survey and the only type of information available for many areas is either an informed or other guess.

Survey Reliability
Population estimate data entered into the AED varies in quality from the identification of individual animals to plain guesswork. The addition of population numbers of varying quality into national, regional and continental totals is, from a statistical viewpoint, invalid and produces misleading results. On the other hand, discarding low-quality numbers can produce equally misleading estimates, as high-quality survey estimates are not available for many areas in which elephants are found.

In order to solve this problem, the AED incorporates a system to accommodate all types of numbers by classifying them according to their type and designating them as estimates and guesses.

As with the previous data aggregation system, which separated numbers into Definite, Probable, Possible, and Speculative, the new ADD system uses a scale of survey reliability, ranging from A (highest) to E (lowest). Survey reliability gives an indication of the level of certainty that can be placed on a given number, as determined by the method employed and how it was carried out.
 
Tables 1 and 2 show the different types of surveys with the range of reliabilities that could be assigned to them and how each number contributes to the columns of estimates and guesses 
depending on its reliability and other criteria. How the columns are then summed to create country, regional, and continental totals is detailed in the next section, “Integration and Presentation of Data.”

The unit of analysis for assigning these categories is the “input zone” and these are listed in each country table. An input zone has only one source of information and may align with a protected area or other land unit, or simply with an area for which there was previous information, better enabling comparison to previous AESRs. Each input zone is assigned a reliability category, and the figure associated with that input zone contributes to the estimates and guesses as shown in Table 2.

Carcass Ratios
The carcass ratio, a measure often calculated in aerial total and sample counts, is the estimated number of dead elephants divided by the sum of estimated dead plus live elephants.  Carcass ratios can provide supporting information to changes in numbers in successive surveys and thus are included in the narrative text alongside survey estimates where available and appropriate. Douglas-Hamilton and Burrill (1991) showed that carcass ratios in excess of 8% for sample counts or 3.3% for total counts were indicative of declining populations.

### Elephant Distribution

African elephants occur in a wide variety of habitats, from tropical swamp forests to deserts. They often move extensively in search of food, water and minerals or in response to disturbance, and the extent to which they move may depend on a large number of factors. In certain areas, seasonal movements are predictable, while in others, movement patterns are far more difficult to decipher. These factors, together with the scarcity of animals at the edges of their distribution, make elephant range a difficult concept to articulate and map. For these reasons, elephant range is broadly defined by the AfESG as the entire area where the species occurs in the wild at any time.

Collecting precise distribution information on such a wide-ranging species as the African elephant presents a number of practical problems, often related to the inaccessibility of some of the habitats in which elephants are found. As a result, the quality of information varies considerably from one area to another and its mapping heavily relies on expert opinion. The range map for a particular country is often updated by a single individual, and thus has a subjective element. Trying to draw a precise range boundary on maps of varying quality and scale is an inexact exercise. Neat, rounded lines may be indicative of scanty knowledge in comparison to the fragmented, more detailed pictures which emerge from countries where more precise information is available. Elephant range often appears to coincide directly with the boundaries of protected areas, because that is where most population surveys are carried out, and elephant movements in and out of protected areas are often unknown or unaccounted for.

Frequently, the depiction of range is also delimited by a natural boundary such as a river or a mountain range for convenience rather than accuracy. When range information in one country extends to a national border, it does not always match the adjacent range in the neighbouring country. While this is sometimes due to different human population densities or land uses across a border, more often lack of reliable information is the cause of what appear to be hard boundaries.

In order to address some of these difficulties, the AED classifies and maps elephant range information into four levels of certainty, as described in Table 3. In addition, range information in the AED is documented and referenced to original sources of data wherever possible to allow some evaluation of the reliability of range information and the reasons why range has either increased or decreased. In some cases these are real changes, while in others they are the result of improved knowledge. Where possible these distinctions have been mentioned in the text.

## Integration and Presentation of Data

### Derivation of National, Regional and Continental Totals

The categorisation system described on the previous page is implemented in the AED through a series of algorithms applied to input zones, or each area for which an individual number is listed in the country tables displaying Elephant Estimates. When executed, these algorithms categorise each input zone in terms of survey type and reliability. The categorised records are then used to produce national, regional and continental totals.

It is important to note that the totals presented for each country and region are minimum numbers, based on the areas that have been surveyed or for which guesses are available. It should also be noted, however, that the totals can include relatively old estimates and if the population is declining, this will yield an overestimate, while it will understate the true number of elephants in an increasing population. In many countries, and in all regions, there are large areas of elephant range where neither surveys nor guesses are available. In the case of Gabon, a modeled extrapolation has been used to generate a guess for unsurveyed areas of the country. This is because there is a large proportion of known range in Gabon that has not been surveyed, but the factors affecting elephant numbers are well known. As the available estimates generally represent only a proportion of the elephant range in a country, they cannot be considered total estimates of the national population. Likewise, the estimates given for the regions and for the continent cannot be interpreted as total regional and continental estimates either.

### Changes in Elephant Numbers and Distribution Over Time

A key question for African elephant conservation and management is whether elephant populations are increasing, decreasing or stable. Comparing estimates from different AESRs to derive continental trends is often attempted but can be invalid and potentially misleading for a number of reasons.

Many of the continent’s elephant populations have never been systematically surveyed. Thus any differences reported between the AESRs refer to a subset of all elephant populations, and may therefore not reflect overall changes, including those in unsurveyed populations. While it is likely that elephant densities in unsurveyed range are lower on average than in surveyed areas, there still may be significant numbers of elephants in areas for which there are no currently estimates or guesses.

Populations surveyed for the first time or populations newly added to the AED (i.e. “new populations” in Table 4) contribute to an apparent overall increase in numbers, even though these do not reflect a true increase in elephants, but rather an improvement in knowledge.  Repeated surveys of the same area may use different techniques or cover different areas, so the results are not directly comparable between different time periods. Where new surveys have not been carried out recently, old estimates will be retained and, over time, degraded to guesses. Retention of these numbers for a significant proportion of the population can lead to a situation where the extent of real change is not reflected in the AESR totals.
 
In order to disentangle these confounding factors from real changes in elephant numbers, the AED relies on a system that links figures contained in the current version of the AED to the corresponding figures in the previous report, and assigns a “reason for change” to each pair, as described in Table 4. The AESR then displays the numbers associated with these reasons for change at the national, regional and continental levels.

Where the more recent surveys in methodologically comparable survey pairs account for a large proportion of the estimate column for a given region, a statistical comparison of elephant numbers over time for those populations can be performed (see Blanc et al., 2005 for details). A list of methodologically comparable surveys featured in this and the previous report is provided in Appendix I.

This report refers to the reason for change “population lost”, or PL, more than it did in the AESR 2007 because of a focus on more deeply investigating the current status of small, isolated populations. The authors recognize the significance of this label and apply it only where there is reliable evidence regarding the loss of a population that is distinct and isolated from other populations.

### Overall Quality of Information and Survey Priorities

The state of knowledge on elephant numbers and distribution varies widely across the continent. Some populations have never been surveyed, or are only surveyed rarely, while others are counted more frequently. The objectives of the AED include promoting the use of standardized, reliable survey techniques, as well as facilitating the task of donors, wildlife authorities and decision-makers in prioritizing their efforts to monitor elephant populations.

In order to assist in meeting these objectives, a simple index measures the quality of elephant population data available at the national, regional and continental levels. Based on this index, a system to identify and prioritize the areas where systematic surveys are most needed has been developed. These measures, both of which are calculated from data contained in the AED, are described below.

The Information Quality Index (IQI) is an unbiased, normalized and scalable index of the overall quality of information on elephant population estimates and guesses. The IQI ranges from zero (no reliable information) to one (full range coverage using good-quality estimates) and is the product of two key variables: a measure of the quality of available data and a measure of the completeness of estimate coverage. The data quality measure is based on the ratio of good quality population data (estimates) to total population data (estimates + guesses); the data completeness measure is based on the ratio of assessed range to total known and possible range. 

The Priority for Future Surveys (PFS) index is designed as an unbiased system for setting priorities for future surveys in order to improve the accuracy of the continental estimate. For a truly accurate continental picture of elephant abundance to emerge, reliable estimates would have to be available for all elephant range. Countries accounting for a larger proportion of total continental range should therefore be prioritized more highly.
 
PFS is therefore based on the IQI (as described above) together with a measure of continental range coverage represented by each country. When calculated for each country, the PFS provides a measure, ranging from one (highest priority) to five (lowest priority), of the countries where population surveys are needed. At the input zone level, the PFS is based on the proportion of national range accounted for by each area. All areas of elephant range that have never been surveyed, i.e. those for which estimates are currently unavailable, are automatically assigned a priority of one. Systematic surveys should be conducted in areas of unsurveyed known range. In areas of doubtful range and unsurveyed possible range, elephant presence/absence should be established prior
to conducting systematic population surveys.

It is important to stress that neither the IQI nor the PFS are measures of the health of elephant populations, or of overall elephant conservation priorities, but rather of the quality of elephant population data and of the need to conduct systematic surveys in the future. For instance, range loss in a country will often result in a decline in the proportion of unassessed range, thus causing the IQI to increase and the priority ranking to decline. A list of all African elephant range states with their IQI and PFS scores is shown in Appendix II.
 
While it is hoped that the PFS system will prove useful for prioritizing populations needing to be surveyed, the system is not intended to be prescriptive. Individual range states may have good reasons to use different criteria and different systems for prioritizing elephant population surveys.

Further details on how the IQI and PFS are calculated are available in the “Data Types and Categories” section of the AESR 2007.

## How This Report is Organized

### Narrative Overview

Each continental, regional, and national section begins with a brief narrative overview intended to supplement the information provided by the maps and tables that follow. The overviews are not intended to provide the reader with exhaustive information on each country, but simply to describe the current situation and to highlight any factors that may have contributed to it or notable changes in these factors since the AESR 2007. 

The overview contains the three following sub-sections:

**General Statistics.** This section provides summary statistics of country area, area of elephant range, proportion of elephant range in protected areas, and the amount of range which has been surveyed or has elephant population estimates, IQI, CITES Appendix and year of that listing for each range state.

**Current Issues.** This section covers any issues that may, directly or indirectly, affect elephant populations and their conservation and management. These may include poaching, political stability, land use changes, large infrastructure developments or relevant new wildlife policies or management arrangements.

**Numbers and Distribution.** This section starts by describing the total population estimates and guesses before discussing individual areas that have been surveyed, the methods employed, and how the data and information were interpreted to result in changes to the tables and maps since the last report. The former sub-sections on “Range Data,” “Population Data” and “Cross-border movements” from the AESR 2007 have been integrated under this heading.

### Tables

**Summary Totals.** These tables (see Table 5) present numbers at the national, regional and continental levels, separated into estimates and guesses. These tables depict the contribution of each survey type to the total area (in km²) for which estimates and guesses are available. In addition, areas of unassessed known and possible range are also shown.

**Total numbers** from the previous report are also displayed in the table; the AESR 2007 data was converted into the AED’s new data display format for direct comparability, after first correcting AESR 2007 errata.

**The Interpretation of Changes in Elephant Estimates from the Previous Report.** These tables show the breakdown and net changes in the estimates and guesses, grouped by the categorised reason for change described in Table 4.
 
**Elephant Estimates.** These tables display the detailed inputs for each country that contribute to the summary totals and interpretation of changes tables. At the national level the table shows results for individual input zones. The centroid of each input zone is provided in decimal geographic coordinates to assist the reader in locating the areas on the accompanying maps. In addition, these input zone tables within each country present details on estimates, their reliability and other metadata, as described in Table 6. Input zones are, as a general rule, listed alphabetically. Where there are many input zones distributed across many parts of a country, sets of geographically adjoining input zones that indicate contiguous elephant populations or other geographically defined subsets are grouped into populations for ease of review and interpretation.

### Maps

A map is shown for the continent, each region and each country, showing elephant distribution, input zones, protected areas within elephant range, national and/or regional boundaries, major towns, rivers and lakes. Countries of adjacent regions are shown to highlight important transfrontier populations, as well as the spatial relationships between elephant populations in neighbouring countries.

### Editorial Conventions and Referencing

In these overviews, several conventions have been adopted for ease of reading. Survey types are marked in bold when referring to the data included in this report, aligning with the tables. Range categories are also marked in bold in reference to the current range, not the category assigned in 2007. Estimates from sample counts are given with 95% confidence limits in the form xx ± yy. Asymmetrical confidence limits are shown in parentheses following the survey estimate. Abbreviations are used for protected areas after they are first named as a “National Park,” (NP), “Forest Reserve,” (FR) or other conservation area. 

The AED relies on a huge number of discrete pieces of information, in the form of maps, survey reports, management plans, emails, phone calls, and news reports, among others.  In addition to their inclusion in this report, these references are all eventually housed in the African Elephant Library, an invaluable and growing archive of over 7,500 references on the African elephant.
